Hey! Thank you for visiting my Github account! Please feel free to take a look around. 

A little bit about me: 

I am currently a grad Student at the University of Essex. 

I received a BA from Coker University(Go Cobras)

I and am hoping to enter a role as a software developer or a cyber security field. 

My favorite thing to do is eat pizza, play sports and laugh.

Please bare with me while I am re-organizing my github! 

Thank you for coming, please let me know if you have any questions!
